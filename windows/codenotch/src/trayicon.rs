//! Draws the usage readings into the tray icon itself, so the numbers are visible next to the
//! clock without opening the notch — and so the notch can be hidden entirely if the user prefers.
//!
//! No font dependency: a tray icon is 16x16 at 100 % scaling, and a hand-written 5x7 bitmap of the
//! ten digits is sharper at that size than any text renderer. Everything is drawn at 32x32 and
//! Windows halves it, an exact 2:1 reduction.
//!
//! EVERY offset below must be EVEN, and that is the whole trick. Each font pixel is drawn as a
//! 2x2 block; a block starting on an odd row or column straddles the 2x2 grid Windows averages
//! over when it halves the image, and the digit turns to grey mush. Aligned to even coordinates
//! each block maps to exactly one output pixel and the result is pixel-perfect. Anything that
//! changes the layout below has to preserve that.
//!
//! Why the digits are white rather than the band colour:
//!   Windows renders this icon at 16, 20 or 24 pixels depending on the display scaling, so the
//!   32x32 source is nearly always downscaled by a fraction rather than by half. Mid-tone coloured
//!   strokes turn to mush under that; white keeps its contrast against any taskbar. The band colour
//!   moves to a solid rule under each number, which is a shape thick enough to survive the resize.
//!
//! Why there are two layouts rather than one:
//!   A digit needs 7 of the 16 available pixels of height. Two rows fit (7 + 1 + 7 = 15). Three do
//!   not — each row would get 5 pixels and the digits would be unreadable. So `numbers` covers one
//!   or two providers, and `bars` covers more by dropping the digits for a column per provider,
//!   filled to its usage. That is a real constraint of the icon size, not a shortcut.

/// One row per scanline, the low 5 bits of each byte being the pixels, left-most bit first.
