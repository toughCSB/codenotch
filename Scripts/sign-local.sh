#
# Sign a local Debug build with a STABLE self-signed identity, so the macOS
# keychain "Always Allow" grant persists across launches.
#
# Why this exists: `make run`/`make build` produce an ad-hoc-signed app. An
# ad-hoc build has no stable code identity, so the keychain access-control
# list cannot match it to a saved "Always Allow" grant — and the prompt to
# read Claude Code's (or another tool's) token returns on *every* launch. A
# stable self-signed identity fixes that: the grant binds to it and sticks.
#
# This is for local development only. It needs no Apple Developer account and
# does not notarize — official releases are Developer ID signed by
# `make release`. The certificate lives in your login keychain and is reused
# on subsequent runs.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/sign-local.sh [path/to/Provider Monitor.app]
# Default target is the app in /Applications.
