/// The dark values are sampled from `docs/design/frame-124-hover-tooltip.png`,
/// not invented, and they differ slightly from the hexes written in the design
/// spec — the frame is the source of truth, so the sampled values win.
///
/// The light values are not sampled from anything, because there is no light
/// frame: they exist only because the glass surface (`NotchSurfaceStyle.glass`)
/// hands light and dark to the Mac's Appearance settings, and white ink on
/// light glass is unreadable. They were picked for at least 3:1 against white.
/// `solid` pins the panel to `darkAqua`, so it keeps the frame's hexes exactly.
///
/// The two tracks are translucent white / black rather than a fixed grey so
/// they darken or lighten whatever is behind them instead of looking painted
/// on top of the glass. Their dark alphas are the ones that composite to the
/// frame's `#303030` / `#2D2D2D` over black, so the solid style is unchanged.
///
/// `notch` and `card` stay pure black: they paint the resting pill, which has
/// to read as the bezel, and the whole surface in the solid style.
