/// Keeps the Claude OAuth token in the login keychain from ageing out.
///
/// Provider Monitor reads that item; only the standalone Claude Code command ever
/// writes it. On a Mac where Claude Code is used through the desktop app the
/// item is therefore written once and then rots — the desktop app renews its
/// own copy elsewhere — and eight hours later every usage reading stops, with
/// nothing the user can do from inside Provider Monitor. That is the hole this fills.
///
/// **How it renews, and why that is a compatibility mechanism rather than an
/// interface.** Running `claude -p` with an empty stdin makes the command go
/// through its whole start-up — which is where it checks the token's age and
/// renews it — and then exit non-zero with "Input must be provided…", because
/// no prompt ever arrives. Verified on a real machine: the keychain item's
/// modification date moves, the expiry advances by eight hours, no transcript
/// is written, no conversation is created, and the debug log shows no call to
/// the messages endpoint.
///
/// None of that is promised by anyone. A future release could stop renewing at
/// start-up, or stop rejecting an empty prompt. Both are handled by judging the
/// *outcome* instead of trusting the command: unless the expiry actually moved,
/// this reports failure and stops trying. And because it never supplies a
/// prompt, a version that started accepting empty input could not be talked
/// into answering one by accident — the failure mode is a wasted launch, never
/// an invented conversation.
