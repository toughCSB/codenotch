/// Every mark used to be filled with the app's text colour, which is legible but
/// leaves shape as the only clue to which provider a cell belongs to — and at
/// the notch's 46 px, Cursor's, Codex's and Grok's marks are far more alike than
/// their names imply. A cell now wears its provider's colour instead.
///
/// Two different promises live in this table, and the difference is kept
/// deliberately visible:
///
/// * **The vendor's own colour** — Anthropic's Claude coral, DeepSeek's blue,
///   Google's blue for a Gemini API key, Meta's blue, Mistral's orange, Qwen's
///   violet.
/// * **A colour chosen for this app** — OpenAI, Cursor and xAI publish
///   monochrome-only logos, so those three are tinted with an accent picked
///   here. It is *not* an official brand colour and is never presented as one.
///   The app already refuses to pass a derived number off as an official one;
///   colours get the same honesty. These are the same three accents the Windows
///   port uses, so a provider looks the same on both.
///
/// `nil` is a decision as well: OpenCode, Ollama and LM Studio publish marks
/// that are already white, and tinting white only makes it a different white.
/// Those keep the app's text colour and look exactly as they did before.
