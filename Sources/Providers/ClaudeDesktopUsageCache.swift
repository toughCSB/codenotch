/// Claude's own limits, read out of Claude Desktop's HTTP cache.
///
/// A third source for the same numbers, and on some machines the only one that
/// answers. The other two both go through Claude Code: `claude "/usage"` prints
/// the windows *when its build still prints them* — some print only a cost
/// summary, which parses to nothing — and the endpoint path needs an OAuth token
/// out of the login keychain, which stays stale until Claude Code next runs and
/// re-mints it. Someone who works in Claude Desktop rather than in the terminal
/// can therefore have a perfectly current subscription, a Desktop window showing
/// 30% of the session used, and a dark ring in the notch.
///
/// Claude Desktop is Chromium, so its `GET /api/organizations/<id>/usage` — the
/// very response its own usage panel draws — lands in a Simple Cache entry on
/// disk, and this reads that entry. No token, no cookie, no keychain, no request
/// to Anthropic, no subprocess, and no write of any kind. If Desktop is absent,
/// closed, has no cache, or the entry is unreadable, this returns nil and the
/// caller falls back to the paths it already had.
///
/// Finding the entry means looking at its neighbours, and the *amount* looked at
/// is the point: of every other file in that directory this reads the first few
/// bytes — enough for the cached URL and no further. A body is only ever
/// decompressed for an entry whose URL is this account's usage endpoint. Nothing
/// else in Claude Desktop's cache is opened, read, or decoded.
///
/// ## Why this can be small
///
/// A general Simple Cache reader would parse the index, both stream trailers and
/// the pickled `HttpResponseInfo`. None of that is needed to answer one question
/// about one entry, and every part of it is a way to break when Chromium's
/// private format shifts. So this reads only what it must: the file header (for
/// the key), the body at the offset that header implies, and — for the timestamp
/// — the `date:` line, found by looking for it rather than by walking a pickle.
/// Every step is bounded, and every failure is nil.
