// The four Zstandard entry points Provider Monitor uses, and nothing else.
//
// `zstddeclib.c` beside this file is the official single-file *decoder*
// amalgamation, and it carries the whole of `zstd.h` inside itself rather than
// shipping it as a header — so there is no header to include. Declaring only
// what is called keeps the vendored surface to four functions instead of the
// 150 kB of public API the real `zstd.h` would add, and keeps the vendored `.c`
// pristine: it is never edited, so re-generating it is a straight overwrite.
//
// Copied verbatim from `lib/zstd.h` of the same pinned release — see README.md
// for the version and how to regenerate. The declarations are ABI-frozen (zstd
// has not changed any of these signatures since 1.0), which is the only reason
// hand-copying them is safe; if a future bump ever did change one, that is a
// deliberate act with the README's steps in front of you.
//
// `ZSTDLIB_API` is deliberately dropped. It only ever expands to a visibility
// attribute for shared-library builds, and this is compiled straight into the
// app binary.
