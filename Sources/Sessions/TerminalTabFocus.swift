///   cmux terminal session (manaflow-ai/cmux#3089) — and Provider Monitor never is.
/// * **Terminal.app** and **iTerm2** match a tab by tty.
/// * **Ghostty** (1.3+) scripts its terminals with an id, a title and a
///   *working directory* but no tty, so it is matched by the session's cwd
///   like cmux; `focus` selects the tab and raises its window in one go.
/// * Everything else publishes nothing (Warp), and the caller falls back to
